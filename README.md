DAY 2 of Project
Working on the main landing page according to wireframe sketch ... started using codepen to verify if code is returning because terminal / vscode started acting up. Got code so far to work in codepen, copy/pasted to vscode and it seems to be working there as well. Now am starting to wonder what i was doing before in vscode ... that caused issues.
